1. **Check the root directory contents:**

    ```
    ls

    You should see:

    - `project/`
    - `README.md`

    If these files are not present, ensure you are in the correct root directory.

    ```
    cd project
    ```

3. **Verify the project directory contents:**

    ```
    ls
    ```

    - `retail/` (or your Django app directory)
    - `db.sqlite3` (or your database file)
    - `manage.py` (Djangoâ€™s management script)

    If these are not present, recheck your directory structure.

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
